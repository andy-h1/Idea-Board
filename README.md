Tech Task Notes:

The idea board was built in React, using LocalStorage and Context API. I used Context API to manage global state to test my understanding on how to use it however if I was to do this tech task again, using local state would have been sufficient. 

Things to do:
- Haven't added an unobtrustive notification when card is updated. Currently have time updated changed on the card.
- Implement storybook for components
- End-to-end testing on app
